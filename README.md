# Dragon plugin for the Advanced Reactor Modeling Interface (ARMI)
This ARMI plugin provides mechanisms for ARMI applications to drive the [Dragon
lattice physics code](https://www.polymtl.ca/merlin/version5.htm) from École
Polytechnique de Montréal.

This plugin is a somewhat minimally example of a useful plugin, and can be used as
guidance for creating your own plugins to your favorite nuclear tool!

More details of how to install and use this plugin to come!
